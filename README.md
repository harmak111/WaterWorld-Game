# WaterWorld Game

Worked on one of the famous Karpathy's waterworld game. The game is initially created with a player playing it manually in mind.

In this project, an automatic version of the famous game has been created using Python with utilizing features of different Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

I have applied DQN (Combining Q-Learning with deep neural networks) and Actor Critic with Eligibility Traces algorithms. 

During the analyzation, it was achieved that Actor Critic with Eligibility Traces is more suitable for this game as it provided with 89% of accuracy while DQN provided with 72% of accuracy.
